# Walkthrough - Setting up a Web Project

[Back to Challenge](../02_setting_up_a_web_project.md)

Set up the app using the [:pill: Ruby Web Project Setup Checklist](../../pills/ruby_web_project_setup_list.md). It's a good idea to learn this list by heart (or, at least, have it handy).

To make sure we have a working set up, let's test-drive the implementation of an index page for our app. That is:

1. Write a failing feature test
2. Solve the feature test in the simplest way possible.


### 1. Failing Feature Test

Let's write a feature test for viewing the index page of the Bookmark Manager app, which will eventually display a list of all Bookmarks. For the time being, we'll just give the page a title and test that it is rendered correctly.

```ruby
# in spec/features/viewing_bookmarks_spec.rb

feature 'Viewing bookmarks' do
  scenario 'visiting the index page' do
    visit('/')
    expect(page).to have_content "Bookmark Manager"
  end
end
```

### 2. Passing in the simplest possible way

If you followed the *Ruby Web Project Setup Checklist* then you'll already have a controller in `app.rb`

```ruby
# in app.rb

require 'sinatra/base'
require 'sinatra/reloader'

class BookmarkManager < Sinatra::Base
  configure :development do
    register Sinatra::Reloader
  end

  get '/' do
    'Hello World'
  end

  run! if app_file == $0
end
```

Let's modify the `/` route to solve this failing test as simply as we can:

```ruby
get '/' do
  'Bookmark Manager'
end
```

Run the feature test using `rspec features` – it passes.

[Here's](https://github.com/makersacademy/bookmark_manager_example/commit/519797a2acc07b20573672a12d92be2c9182375b) a commit of this stage.

## Summary

1. We set up a web project
2. We wrote a failing test.
3. We solved the failing test in the simplest possible way.


Now we have a working project, we're ready to implement the first full feature - viewing bookmarks.
