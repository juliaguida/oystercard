## Using Rake

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md#challenges)

We've built a Sinatra application that can read and write from and to a database. It's structured in an MVC style, and has test and development environments.

Whenever a new developer wants to clone and run our application, they have to dive into `psql` to set up test and development databases with the correct tables. That's a problem: we can make it easier for them.

In this challenge, you will use **Rake**, a **task runner**, to automate the tasks of setting up the database. You'll start by moving the test environment setup script to Rake, and write a script to set up a database through Rake.

## Learning Objectives covered

* Use Rake to automate environment tasks.

## To complete this challenge, you will need to

- [ ] Replace the setup test database script (the one that adds links to the database) with a Rake task.
- [ ] Replace the line in `spec_helper.rb` that runs the test database setup script with a call to the Rake task.
- [ ] Write a new Rake task to set up the development and test databases from scratch. It should run when a developer types `rake setup`.
