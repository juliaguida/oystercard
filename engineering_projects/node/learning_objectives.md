  * Compare and contrast to another MVC framework
* Clone the [demo app](https://github.com/Eslamunto/ProductsApp/blob/master/app.js)
  * [Here's](https://codeburst.io/writing-a-crud-app-with-node-js-and-mongodb-e0827cbbdafb) how it was built
* Get the application up and running
* Diagram the sequence of events when you run `npm start`
  * HINT: Some of your _debugging tools_ will come in handy here
* Diagram a request and response cycle of a user interacting with the app

### Specific goals

**Important:** Feel free to add, update this as much as you feel is helpful. Use your team, pair partners, or a coach to break each step into smaller steps if it's helpful.

1. I can TDD fizzbuzz using Node.js
2. I can TDD the airport challenge using Node.js
3. I can use npm to manage dependencies
4. I can TDD an Express app that shows 'hello, world' at `localhost:8080/`
