| Planning | Primarily by teacher | By participative decision-making
| Diagnosis of needs | Primarily by teacher | By mutual assessment
| Setting goals | Primarily by teacher | By mutual negotiation
| Designing a learning plan | Content units, course syllabus, logical sequence | Learning projects, learning contracts, sequenced in terms of readiness
