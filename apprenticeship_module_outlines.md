## Week 4: Object-Oriented Design

As a software developer, there are some things you can be sure of.

> 1. You're going to work on codebases that are, or will become, complex
> 2. How you manage complexity has long term consequences

Object Oriented Design (sometimes called Object Oriented Programming) is one way of ensuring that complexity is well managed and it's what we'll focus on this week.  It's important, however, to understand that other approaches exist and that the same goals underpin them all.

> We seek to write code that is easy to read, reason about and change by
> 1. Avoiding repetition
> 2. Breaking programs down into small, simple, pieces
> 3. Ensuring that the relationships between pieces are simple

Everything you learn about OOD this week will map onto one or more of those three goals.

### Getting started

#### Reflect on TDD

The skills and concepts dealt with this week consolidate and build on the things you learned last week, so take a moment to reflect on Test Driven Development.

* What did you learn about your progress from doing the Airport challenge?
* Can you test-drive a class with instance variables and methods?
* Can you test-drive two classes that work together?
* Do you always write tests first?

If you need to spend more time working on these things, go for it!

#### Read and discuss this module's goals

By the end of the module all developers can:
* Review another person's code and learn from what they wrote
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage

Stretch:
* Test classes in isolation using mocking and dependency injection
* Apply some basic OOP principles in tightly focused exercises

#### Read and discuss the relevant course goals

* I can write standards-compliant, clean object-oriented code
* I test-drive my code
* I can design a system

And you can remind yourself of the rest [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/apprenticeship_starting_pack/course_goals.md).

### Resources
* [The 4 pillars of OOD](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260/)
* [Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby](https://www.poodr.com/), by Sandi Metz, is very highly regarded.  Put it on your post-bootcamp reading list if you don't have time for it now.
* [SOLID](https://rubygarage.org/blog/solid-principles-of-ood) principles with Ruby examples

## Week 5: The Web

This week you'll learn how to build web applications in Ruby, using TDD.

### This module's main goals
By the end of the week, all developers can:
* Write feature tests using Capybara
* Test-drive a simple Sinatra app
* Follow an effective process to debug web applications
* Explain and diagram the HTTP request/response cycle
* Explain and diagram the MVC pattern

Before you start, take a moment to think about how you will track your progress towards these goals. Write down your plan and share it with your peers.

Then, every morning, you should come back to these goals and rate your progress.

On Friday, you'll do a solo exercise which will help you to test your self assessment.
### Resources

* [How the web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works) – you'll probably get asked about this in a job interview one day ;)
* [History of the web](https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw59n8BRD2ARIsAAmgPmJcknSPKlT1ckzH7grP8DX_Mxr1be9qlqv13OEC9aI7pYe0CJoAVKQaAikrEALw_wcB)

## Week 6: Databases

This week, you'll learn how to build database-backed web applications.  Along the way, you'll build your own [Object Relational Mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataMapper). Bear in mind that you'll probably never have to do this again – you'd use an existing tool like [Active Record](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activerecord) or [Ruby Object Mapper](https://rom-rb.org/) instead – but building your own tools is a great way to learn how they work.

[START HERE](./pills/databases.md) with a brief introduction to databases.

### This module's main goals

By the end of the module all developers can:

* Diagram the data flow from user action to server resource and back again
* Explain the basics of how databases work, including:
   - What tables are and how they are structured
   - What structured query language (SQL) is used for
   - One to one relationships
   - One to many relationships
   - Many to many relationships
* Follow an effective debugging process for database-backed web applications
* Build a simple web app that can read from and write to a database

### Exercises for self-directed learning

## Week 7: MakersBnB

During this week, you'll work in teams to [build a program according to a specification][makersbnb].  Technically, a lot of what you do will be a recap of the preceding weeks.

### This module's main goals

By the end of this module all developers can:

* Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
* Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
* Run stand-ups and retrospectives
* Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
* Give and receive meaningful code review
* Recognise that contributions to teamwork do not always involve writing code

### Tools and Resources

* [Trello](https://trello.com/) is a todo list with superpowers!
* [Miro](https://miro.com/) is a great tool for keeping all your team's plans and reflections in one place. You can use it alongside or instead of Trello.
* [A brief into to git branching workflows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJnFGMclhU8&ab_channel=GitHubTraining%26Guides)
* [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) is a lovely resource for learning about how git branches work.
* And [here's](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) Git's docs on branching.

### Your schedule

Some team meetings have been added to your schedule already:

1. Team standups, where you'll quickly check in with each other and communicate your plans for the day.  Keep them brief. If you need time to discuss things in more detail, add specific meetings to your agenda for that.
2. Team stand downs, where you'll quickly reflect on how your day has gone.  Again keep them brief.
4. Sprint planning, where you'll aim to plan what work your team will take on in the next sprint.
5. Sprint review, where you look back on the work done in the current sprint. If you had clients, they'd be in the room for this one.
5. Sprint retrospectives, where you'll seek answers to the question "how can we be a better team?".  You'll think about what you did well, what could be improved and what actions you'll take to realise those improvements.

You might consider adding these to your schedule:

1. Independent learning.  Make sure you strictly time box this and always include time for sharing what has been learned.  I'd recommend that you keep these to 45 minutes plus 15 minutes for sharing.
2. Mobbing.  This is where you all 'gather around' one machine and write code together. It can be useful to have 3+ brains and pairs of eyes on a problem but these sessions can become tiresome.  Again, you should strictly time box these sessions.  You should also watch out for signs of disengagement – if you see them, it's time to mix things up.

### Why so many meetings??

For some of you, this will seem like overkill and you'll want to 'just get cracking', or something like that.  These meetings, however, are designed to ensure that by the time you do get cracking, you are happier and more productive.

1 hour spent working on a really well understood task, pulling in the right direction, is worth infinitely more than 2 hours working on a poorly defined task, creating something that doesn't meet the specifications.

[makersbnb]: https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/makersbnb

### Who will facilitate your meetings?

On placement, you'll work in multidisciplinary teams, with people like Deliver Mangers and Product Managers, who provide vision and support.  This week, you'll do a lot of these things for yourselves.  I'd recommend that each day you nominate someone to facilitate team meetings.  Ideally, everyone in the team has at least one day in this role.

As facilitator, your most important job is to create and maintain a friendly space so that everyone in the team feels comfortable contributing.  You might occasionally need to take a step back in order to do this well.

### What are the hallmarks of a great team?

How many of these can you tick off?

   [ ] We all understand every ticket in the backlog\
   [ ] We do not have to ask for clarity on tickets in the middle of a sprint\
   [ ] All of our code is peer reviewed\
   [ ] We are sharing knowledge within the team\
   [ ] We all feel comfortable speaking openly in team retrospectives

What would you add to the list?

## Week 8: Learn A New Language

In this module you'll focus on developing a great process for learning a new language.  From time to time you should ask yourself this question: what would my plan be if I were to start learning another new language tomorrow?  You might find that your answer to this question changes during the week.

You'll either be learning Javascript (using the materials outlined below) or Java, [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/java-apprenticeship-module).  The goals are the same, either way.  If you're not sure which track you should take, please reach out to your coach.

### Javascript

> For the Javascript track, read on.  If you're due to learn Java, please go back to the link up there 👆

If you already know some Javascript, please keep an open mind and pay close attention to how the week is structured. If you can do this really well, you'll come away with some insights into how to learn new programming languages.

#### This module's main goals

By the end of the module all developers can:

* Describe a process for learning a new language
* Follow an effective process for learning a new language
* Compare and contrast Javascript and Ruby
* Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript

#### The broader course goals relevant to this module are...

* I can design and build user interfaces
* I test-drive my code
* I use my own initiative

#### Exercises for self-directed learning

These exercises can be used for independent study, or enhanced by group discussion.

#### Individual challenge

For this module there are several options.  You should take a moment to decide which is the right one for you before getting started.  If you choose something and regret it, go back and choose something else! :)

* Create a JS app that fulfils the [Office Management Challenge user stories](https://github.com/makersacademy/office-management-challenge#task)
   - A familiar problem in a new language
   - Do this one if you would like to focus on basic Javascript syntax
   - You can either create a new repo or fork/clone this one and remove all the Ruby
   - STRETCH: Can you extend the challenge to include a simple user interface?
* Create a JS app that fulfils the [Takeaway Challenge user stories](https://github.com/makersacademy/takeaway-challenge#task)
   - Towards the end of the Takeaway challenge, you'll have fun sending text messages with the Twilio API! :)
   - Do this one if you want something a little bit more challenging
   - You can either create a new repo or fork/clone this one and remove all the Ruby
   - STRETCH: Can you extend the challenge to include a simple user interface?
