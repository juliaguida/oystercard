# Seasonal Break Information for Developers on Immersive

Hello everyone! Makers is closed for seasonal breaks in both winter and spring. We encourage you to use this time to refresh, but this repo exists in case you'd like to do some programming. 

If you, like me, find programming not just a challenging profession but also an interesting intellectual pursuit, you might enjoy the following challenges.

## Fundamentals of TDD

We cover test-driven-development plenty at Makers of course, but if you'd like to get ahead or have another perspective on it, this course from the dev consultancy thoughtbot comes well recommended.

> You've heard about testing, and even better "Test-Driven Development", but you're still not sure exactly what they are. Well now you'll know!
In this trail, thoughtbot developers Harry Schwartz and Ian C. Anderson cover core principles of writing code with Test-Driven Development. You'll learn about the benefits of testing, the way testing first applies positive design pressure to your code, and how to apply TDD to your own development.

[Get started here.](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/fundamentals-of-tdd)

#### Reasons to pick this

* You'd like to improve your test-driven development.
* You don't know test-driven development yet, and you'd like to get ahead.

### Exercism

[Exercism](https://exercism.io) is a good website for learning your second programming language or beyond. I'd suggest:

* Python
* Java (we regularly have jobs via partners that use this language)
* Scala (less frequently than Java, but we also have jobs upcoming that use this language)
* Typescript
* Go
* Rust

#### Reasons to pick this

* You'd like to learn a new language.
* You'd like to expand the breadth of your programming knowledge

### Birthday App

> Your challenge is to build a web app that will ask the user for a name and birthday.

[Get started here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/intro_to_the_web/post_challenges/birthday_app.md)

#### Reasons to pick this

* You'd like to develop or refresh your understanding of simple web apps.
* It's your birthday this week.

### Cipher World Exercises

> Your mission is to build a program that can encrypt and decrypt files with a chosen cipher.
>
> Each part of this adventure has a set of Acceptance Criteria: these are mostly written as indicated method calls and their expected return values. Find part 1, and start there. Grab the method calls and expectations, use a testing framework of your choice to speed your development, and start designing and test-driving.

[Get started here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/practicals/adventures/cipher-world)

#### Reasons to pick this

* You'd like the idea of encrypting secrets.
* You'd like to develop your programming skill with some carefully sequenced exercises from simpler to more challenging.

### Learning by Building RSpec Exercise

> We're going to build RSpec, step by step.
>
> In the process, we'll prove to ourselves that our tools aren't magic. They're made up of simple concepts that we can understand, with enough time and thoughtfulness.

[Get started here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/main/practicals/adventures/learning_by_building_rspec.md)

#### Reasons to pick this

* You're curious as to how RSpec looks so different.
* You'd like to demystify RSpec through a detailed engagement with how it works.

### Hello Cloud World Mini-Course

> This short course is meant to provide you with a lightweight introduction to DevOps. We will learn what DevOps is, where it fits in current workflows and also get hands-on and tackle our first Cloud project focusing on some DevOps practices using a designated Cloud provider.
>
> At the end of it, you will be equipped with enough context to keep moving forward in your DevOps journey! 🔮

[Get started here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/main/devops)

#### Reasons to pick this

* You're interested in DevOps, Cloud Engineering, or how software systems actually get deployed.

### Algorithmic Complexity Course

> This course focuses on an aspect of Computer Science that is relished by many developers, called algorithmic complexity.
>
> This is the part of computer science that deals with how efficient programmes are. We will also take a deeper look at how programmes interact with memory, and how to use that to make our own programmes faster.

[Get started here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/main/algorithmic_complexity)

#### Reasons to pick this

* If you are interested in computer science.
* If you feel worried about missing some computer science concepts in your education (though note that it is rarely a problem at early stages).
* If you are interested in analysis and optimisation problems.

### Introduction to COBOL Course

> In this module you will learn COBOL the language. You will do so by going through a series of exercises, building up to a larger project. That larger project is a greetings card generator. By the end, you should be able to read and write straightforward COBOL programs that read, manipulate, and write data.

[Get started here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/cobol-intro)

#### Reasons to pick this

* While COBOL is still used quite widely, you will very probably never use it in your job.
* So you should pick this only if you are interested in historical programming languages.
